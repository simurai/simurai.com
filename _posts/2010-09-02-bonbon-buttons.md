My goal was to create sweet looking __CSS buttons__ with minimal markup. They use only one PNG for the background noise, everything else is rendered by the browser. I’m quite happy how they turned out, but of course, the lack in cross-browser support makes them just another demo.. for now. ;-)

If you are interested in more details, I wrote some sort of tutorial and of course you can click them.

## Update

Looking at them in 2014, I think their time is over. So I moved them into the [archive](/archive/buttons/). Might still be useful purely educational.
